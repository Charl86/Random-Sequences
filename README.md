# Introduction
This program takes a file of randomly generated sequences and processess them, or creates a new file of randomly generated sequences in order to process it. During the processing phase the program will normalize the sequences, find the mean value, find the standard deviation and sorts them using the Selection Sort and Bubble Sort algorithms.

# About
This was one of my first 'major' projects (back then as a programming d√©butant), in which I implemented concepts learned in Computer Science classes such as Abstract Data Types, classes, objects, implementing basic sorting algorithms, etc. while also learning how to use git to track and version file changes. Although it was a small, harmless project, I learned a lot from it and it serves as a reference point to look at how I used to code and organize a project versus how I do so now.

This started as a group class project that was then continued independently.

# Usage
## Unix-based
In order to user the program, simply download the repository and compile the .cpp files. A command like this should work, assuming g++ is available in a Unix-based system:
```
g++ -g main.cpp Sequence.cpp -o <executable filename>
```
Then run the program by typing:
```
./main
```

## Windows
If MingGW is installed on a Windows-based system, the above command should work except that the executable extension must be `.exe`. For example, in Powershell:
```
g++ -g main.cpp Sequence.cpp -o <filename>.exe
```
should work, assuming the directory where `g++.exe` resides in is added to the path.

Then, to run the program, simply type:
```
.\main.exe
```
